# python-api-challenge

Within the 'WeatherPY' folder, you'll encounter two distinct code files. Initiate your exploration with 'weatherpy.ipynb,' and subsequently proceed to 'vacationpy.ipynb.' It is crucial to execute 'weatherpy.ipynb' first as it loads a CSV file, which is a prerequisite for the seamless continuation of 'vacationpy.ipynb.'

All the files generated by 'weatherpy.ipynb' will be stored in the 'output' folder. Although the folder currently contains output files, you have the option to delete them if you wish to observe the files being outputted as you run the code.

This code utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to examine and illustrate comparisons and correlations in weather conditions among cities in the northern and southern hemispheres.

Acknowledging the challenging nature of this project, I must admit that I was unable to complete my code. However, I intend to revisit and update it in the future as I conduct further research and gain a better understanding of how to progress.

I extend my gratitude to my incredible classmates for their guidance, and I also benefited from resources such as W3Schools Online, YouTube, Stack Overflow, Reddit, and pre-recorded Zoom classroom sessions. These sources collectively played a pivotal role in assisting me in reaching the extent of progress achieved in this project.
